# simpy-Airport-simulation

Simulating an airport in python using the simpy library. Investigating how bad weather, flight delays and traffic are affecting the
landing- and take-off queues. The script comes with adjustable parameters as: number of landingstrips, number of snowplow trukcs, probability of delays and much more.
The purpose with the simulation is to see how the airports can decrease landing and take-off queue by i.e. increase number of runways or buy more snowplow trucks.
